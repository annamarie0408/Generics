# Generics

Write	main	method	and	call	the	methods	with	various	data	
types
* Create a main method that creates data (hard code arrays and
ArrayLists) and calls each method three different ways (meaning
different types of data) and prints out what the method returns.
* For example, for 19.7 you might call it with an Integer array and a
* Character array like this:

 Integer[] ints = {1,2,3,4,5,6,18,30};

System.out.print(binarySearch(ints, 18));

// returns 6, print it out using println“BinarySearch for 18 returns position 6”
* Character[] chars = {'a', 'd', 'm'};

System.out.print(binarySearch(chars, 'm'));

// returns 6, print it out using printlnBinarySearch for ‘m’ returns position 2”
